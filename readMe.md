# Group assigment IoT

  We are using React, Socket.io, hosted with express, communicating to our ardiuno using serial, Data is stored using mongodb (mongoose)

  I will update, screenshots & our submission just for reference to the public. As 100% of our learning was through open source or youtube videos.

  If you would like to reach out with regards to how we have implemented something, feel free to leave a comment or fork & dm me. I only ask for a star :D

  Possibly, in the future i will stream line this process with better coding practices.

# Considerations
